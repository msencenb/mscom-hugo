I listen to [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) occasionally, and this past week's podcast episode was titled, _Regrets, I've Had a Few_. The first story in the episode was all about a childhood experience that ended up sticking with someone until the present day, including the massive amount of guilt associated with it. It's something we've all probably experienced, some childhood memory that is so cringeworthy it makes you feel terrible inside just thinking about it for the rest of your life.

My own regretful event happened while I was a freshmen or sophomore in high school. I was hanging out with my best friend and two of his friends from church (siblings in fact). I was going through a bit of an awkward phase, an introvert slowly expanding his social circle and trying to act a little 'cool'.

I have no idea how the conversation ever turned towards my humiliating moment, but it ended with me mimicking one of the middle school wrestling coaches from my school district who has a slight stutter and twitch. My friend's eyes got really big, icy glares were sent my way by the two siblings, and he slowly said,

"Matt, that's their Dad"

That moment is crucified in my head forever. To this day I feel awful and humiliated about it. It was rude, uncalled for, and distinctly not cool. I apologized to the siblings, but it was one of those incidents that you can be forgiven for and never truly get over in your heart. That day taught me an important lesson, namely that making fun of people for circumstances outside of their control, is highly offensive. I've never made the same mistake again.
