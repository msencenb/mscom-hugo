Yesterday, [Mandy](http://treading-lightly.com/) and I took a flying trapeze class at the [Circus Center in San Francisco](http://circuscenter.org/flyingtrapeze), and it was amazing. A little bit terrifying to climb the ladder the first (ok... every) time, but also safe and adrenaline inducing.

The class was a birthday gift courtesy of Mandy, and if you are in the Bay area, take note. There are lots of unique activities that can be gifted that provide unique experiences instead of physical objects. Highly recommended, if you are looking for a shared experience unlike any other. Without further ado... here's the finale of the class, in which you get 'caught' by an instructor while hanging upside down:
