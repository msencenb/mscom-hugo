"They just fired me"

The words caught in her throat and reverberated oddly into my brain. I could feel the moment starting to warp into some sort of shakespearian 'lesson' I was supposed to latch onto and spit out at my junior employees years into the future; and yet I simply stared staunchly back into that statements twisted face in denial. Standing before me was one of my best friends who I had recruited a year earlier to be a linchpin in a company I helped co-found. The episode would be my first tottering step into the question of friends vs business, questionable ethics and a decision that would forever alter the trajectory of my life.

## The Facts As I Saw Them

The company I helped 'co-found' was a medical company and my friend was taking a gap year to apply to medical school. She was hired to be a liaison working directly in our beta doctor's offices as we worked the kinks out of the product; arguably one of the most important roles in the entire company (in my mind at least).

Her performance was well above satisfactory. She had a natural knack for befriending doctors; being a soon to be medical student and a profound interest in seeing how medicine was 'actually' practiced probably helped quite a bit.

She learned enough front end html/css to meaningfully contribute to things like FAQ web pages and support documents that were customer visible. She also took on the role of QA tester when the need arose.

She was not a direct report to me, the company was only 7 people at this time so there was no real 'hierarchy'. She worked closely with a retired doctor who was our primary business development guy. From my observations of her work she was a bit scatter brained and worked odd hours. To my knowledge this was never a huge problem until the day of the firing.

She was accepted into a top fifteen medical school. In June the team decided to offer her a full time position if she decided to defer entry to medical school for another year. The company also decided to setup a special stock vesting schedule that would allow her to vest her promised shares in the single year she had remaining with us. She accepted the position and deferred medical school another year.

A new CEO was hired a few weeks after she accepted her new position, the firing took place in August (about two months after the new CEO was brought onboard).

## Cleaning House

After those words had rattled my brain to it's core I spent about a week contemplating the event and how I would react to it. On one hand I had some idea that a lot of people believed that business is business, which at this point included the people responsible for firing my friend. The CEO, whom was supposed to be leading the charge into Series A territory and had a fair amount of executive experience, had made it clear that my friend didn't 'fit with the team'.

And yet deep within my bones I knew it was bullshit. How does one go from being an all-star employee, who gets a special stock vesting schedule, to being fired less than two months later? Upon confronting the CEO and asking for reasons as to the firing I got back the typical 'safe' responses.

"She lied on her timesheet"

Apparently the CEO had timed the employee one day and the employee had counted the time she showered as working time (about twenty minutes). A decidedly simple problem to fix by either moving her to salary or billing in weekly chunks; especially given the fact that the employee in question regularly worked odd hours. As a leader it's your job to enable your employees to do their best work.... not... whatever watching shower time of one of your junior employee's counts as in exec land. This employee just deferred admission to one of the top med schools in the country for the opportunity to work for you; do you truly believe she would purposefully report a half hour off to get an extra dime?

"She did not improve after warnings"

I might have believed this one... if the CEO who claimed to give the warning would have actually been in the office to see improvement for more than half a week after giving said warning. In addition the week in question resulted in the highest week on week growth of product usage (500%) we had ever seen, due largely in part to the efforts of the employee. Perhaps the saddest part of the 'warning' was that the quality of interaction between the CEO and employee turned into the employee doing whatever the CEO wanted instead of offering her own opinions like she historically did. Being a leader who delivers warnings in a fashion that turns your employees into brainless cattle is an effortless way as a leader to sink any sort of independent thought. Being a leader is about putting the smartest people you can find into a room, framing a problem and then coaxing the team into building out a solution that borrows expertise from all relevant corners of the collective brain. Offering too strong of an opinion as a leader, or even worse, pulling the 'because I'm CEO' card is not effective leadership.

"She does not fit well with the team"

There might be some far flung situation where someone clashes with the culture of a company and needs to be let go, but in this context is just a load of utter crap. You don't go from being asked to defer your medical school entrance to not fitting well with the team in under two months. Especially not when the only addition to the team was a new CEO.

## Humanity vs Business

I believe that everyone in the company knew that what was happening was unfair. Perhaps if the employee who got shafted was not a close friend I would have carried on with the company spouting empty platitudes like "business is business" to try to keep the stain out of my soul. As it stood I was more angry than I have ever been in my entire life. It wasn't a hot flash of anger either, it was a deep burning anger that bubbled just below the surface of my chest.

I had agreed to be the first technical member of this team because I believed it offered the opportunity for me to learn, because I was the only person in their 20's on the team (at least before my friend was hired). Surely the wealth of experience, and the serial entrepreneur on the team, would show me how startups were guided from birth to funding and hopefully beyond. Instead my tenure at the company ended in a torrent of disappointment.

I told the serial entrepeneur that I was disappointed. He acted like his hands were tied, he had after all hand picked this CEO... he could hardly stick up for a junior employee when the fate of the company hinged on the CEO's success. That's what it boiled down to really. When confronted with what is right and what you think will make a business grow what do you chose? Do you pick humanity or worldly success?

The retired doctor who worked most closely with her I like very much, but I also found him lacking in backbone. He chose the company over the right thing. Perhaps he feels the technology could change the medical industry and that he would rather continue on with that noble cause than bother with one unfortunate incident. Perhaps I'm too young to know the difference. As it stands I think he supported the wrong thing and he knows it.

## Leaving

I walked away.

I walked into the CEO's office and told her I believed the employee was fired solely because she did not like her. I had a conversation with the serial entrepeneur in which I told him I truly looked up to him, but I simply could not continue in a company in which I believe a person had been so truly wronged. I had a bullshit goodbye lunch with the remainder of the team.

## Beyond

The company continues on and from what I hear is quite far along. Series A and 15 people, although no major deals in place yet.

I've spent the intervening time having my eyes and personality magnificently expanded by seeing the world. Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Ski season in Tahoe, Ireland, England, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and several more upcoming. It's been the best year of my entire life and I urge you (especially you americans) to take a long term trip.

I don't really have words of wisdom for you, simply a story of dirty laundry. I urge you to truly think about what you are doing with your life. I urge you to stop thinking about worldly success and think compassionately about how the choices you make everyday affect the lives of those around you. Most importantly I urge you to throw off the bowlines and get out of your comfort zone. If business is all about business, but it will fill my bank account with a few extra zeros is it worth it?

I know the answer I will give you every time... what answer would you give me?
