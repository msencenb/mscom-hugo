My woodshop classes continued this summer with a short course at [Palo Alto Adult School](https://paadultschool.org/class/woodworking/).

This time I managed to cobble together a wooden toolbox. There were a fair number of new skills to pick up, including the use of a router for box joints, and various bits and pieces. I completely screwed up the dado creation, which resulted in the walnut inlay you'll see in the photos. There were other minor screwups (like blowing up the entire handle), but I think it turned out functional.

I will be continuing on with further woodworking projects. Much like baking bread, a topic for another post, I enjoy the limited nature of projects like this. You build it, adjust for your mistakes in the process, but then it's finished. That's a nice change from the landscape of software, which is fundamentally fluid and incomplete.
