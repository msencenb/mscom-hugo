I had a miniature crisis in January with my new SaaSÂ product for wrestling teams. I was working on weekends and generally making myself miserable, due to an arbitrary deadline I had set for myself. The thing about that arbitrary deadline? No one cared. I told the team I'm working with that I would be pushing back the launch until after the season, and the coach just said "Sounds good to me!". It was a good lesson to remember.

[This article](https://blog.baremetrics.com/getting-out-of-the-startup-rat-race-66a5a0ca3055#.hgy55qrcv), by Josh Pigford of [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/), describes that lesson much more eloquently than I can here. Give it a read if you have a moment.
